This project focuses on creating a smart building system to monitor household switches (gas, water, and electricity) and manage the home audio system. Using an ESP32 microcontroller equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules, data from various sensors is collected and processed. The system interacts with push buttons and micro switches to monitor water and electricity switches. Furthermore, it controls the audio system through a DFPlayer module, receiving commands and managing music playback. Additionally, a database is implemented to track requests and responses to the MQTT broker, ensuring efficient communication between components and central processors.
